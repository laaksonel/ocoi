(** Implements authentication/authorization for requests on a per route basis using the [Authorization] HTTP header

    Example use:
    {[let my_route = get "/my_route" (Ocoi.Auth.Checks.accept_all (fun _ -> `String "Hello world!" |> respond'))]}

    implements a very simple kind of "authentication" that accepts all requests to [/my_route].

    A more useful example would replace {!Ocoi.Auth.Checks.accept_all} with some other function with signature
    [auth_credential option -> Request.t -> bool] that takes an [Authorization] head and returns whether it is valid for
    the associated request. For instance, using JWT tokens for authentication:
    {[let jwt_algorithm = Jwt.HS256 "SupaSekretKey"

  let check_user jwt_payload req =
    let jwt_user = Jwt.(find_claim (claim "user_id") jwt_payload) in
    let req_id = param req "id" in
    jwt_user = req_id

  let auth_func = let token_check = Ocoi.Auth.Checks.jwt ~algorithm:jwt_algorithm ~validate:check_user in
  Ocoi.Auth.Checks.bearer_only token_check

  let get_user = get "/users/:id" (authenticate auth_func (fun _ -> get_user (param req "id") |> respond'))]}

*)
